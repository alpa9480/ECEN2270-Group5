# ECEN2270-Group5
The Polite Driver: Group 5's Final Project

The Polite Driver is an add-on to the basic funtionality of the 4-wheel robot built in ECEN 2270. The code 
was created in Arduino IDE

This code adds blinking lights for turns, break lights for planned pauses, and hazard lights when stopped by 
an obstacle.

This update requires use of 2 LED lights and a Ultrasonic Proximity sensor. Refer to the pin number macros at 
the top of the document for attaching these extra components to the Arduino microcontroller.

Code by Alexis Palau, Rylan Moore, and Brooke Cochran
